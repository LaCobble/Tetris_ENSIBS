## Description
This project is a Tetris game implemented in Java. It was developed as a group project for a school assignment. The project was divided into two parts: object modeling and programming. Initially, a team of two members worked on the object modeling, and later, a team of four members worked on the programming phase.

The objective of the Tetris game is to manipulate falling blocks called Tetriminos to create horizontal lines without any gaps. When a line is completed, it disappears, and the player earns points. The game ends when the Tetriminos stack up to the top of the playing field.

The project utilizes Java's object-oriented programming principles and graphical user interface components to provide an interactive and enjoyable gaming experience.

Random generation of Tetriminos
Falling and moving Tetriminos
Rotating Tetriminos
Clearing completed lines
Scoring system
Game over condition
